Note for Scan:


              * 1 time from up left to low right
              * 
              *
              * I could imagine like, if the scan just detected an collision, somehow, it goes to the next block checks the colour of the next block,
              * if it is the same makes it glow (which i think is its own state) and then just goes up down left right,
              * if different colour apply movement data, if same colour another glow.
              * 
              * What I just have to check is from where the transition into colour comes and then look one block even further.
              * Then I can proceed like i initially planned.
              *
              *
              * Quick question: do explosions occur after all blocks have finished sliding, or as soon as one block collides?

 blocks start sliding, it waits for all blocks to finish moving, and then matches happen

 That's definitely simpler

 yeah that was one of the very first things I asked ashley, because it meant saving a lot of effort hehe

         // have signal "scan complete" for display
         // complete scan, animate changes, complete scan, animate changes  


         I need to determine the end of a turn, i think i could do that by comparing the state of the field between two scans, and if nothing changed, spawners act and the turn advances
